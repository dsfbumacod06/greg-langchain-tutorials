    "I always thought that job posts were a gold mine of information, and often suggest identifying targets based on these (go look at relevant job posts for companies that might want to work with you). Secondly, I also automatically ping BuiltWith from our CRM and send that to OpenAI and have a summarized tech stack created - so I see the benefit of having this as an investor. <br><br>\n",
    "For me personally, I like to get as much data as possible about a company. Would love to see job post cadence, type of jobs they post and when, notable keywords/phrases used, tech stack (which you have), and any other information we can glean from the job posts (sometimes they have the title of who you'll report to, etc.). <br><br>\n",
